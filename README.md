Great — thanks for sharing the script and your current README. I see your repo only really contains:

* `fc_trainer.py` (training script)
* `player_price_history_85plus.csv` (data)
* `predictions.json` (saved predictions, too large to share)

So the README you uploaded is over-engineered for what’s actually in the repo (it assumes `src/`, notebooks, docs, etc. that aren’t there). I’ll simplify and align it with your **actual files**, while still making it clean and professional. I’ll also create a minimal `requirements.txt` you can drop in.

Here’s the revised **README.md**:

**Predicting EA Sports FC player prices using machine learning (XGBoost)**

</div>

## 📋 Overview

This project trains an **XGBoost regression model** to predict player prices in **EA Sports FC (Ultimate Team)**.  
The model is trained on player attributes, metadata, and temporal features extracted from market history.

Main steps:
- 🗂️ Load and clean price history data  
- ⏱️ Engineer temporal features (month, week, weekend, etc.)  
- 🔡 Encode categorical features (clubs, positions, etc.)  
- ⚡ Train XGBoost with early stopping  
- 📊 Evaluate with MAE, RMSE, R², and MAPE  
- 📈 Generate plots for feature importance and residuals  
- 💾 Save trained model (`eafc_price_predictor.json`)  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eafc-price-predictor.git
cd eafc-price-predictor
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Training

```bash
python fc_trainer.py
```

This will:

* Train the model on `player_price_history_85plus.csv`
* Save:

  * `eafc_price_predictor.json` (model)
  * `model_analysis.png` (feature importance & prediction plot)
  * `residual_analysis.png` (residual distribution)
  * `predictions.json` (example predictions)

---

## 📊 Example Output

After training, you’ll see evaluation metrics like:

```
Train Set:
  MAE:     20,884 coins
  RMSE:    90,569 coins
  R²:      0.9840
  MAPE:    12.39%

Validation Set:
  MAE:     23,981 coins
  RMSE:   108,530 coins
  R²:      0.9780
  MAPE:    13.71%
```

And saved plots:

* `model_analysis.png`

  * Left: Top 20 feature importances
  * Right: Predicted vs Actual prices

* `residual_analysis.png`

  * Distribution of residuals
  * Residuals vs predicted scatter

👉 Do you want me to also include a **separate script for inference** (e.g., `predict.py`) so you can load `eafc_price_predictor.json` and make new predictions, or should the repo stay training-only?
